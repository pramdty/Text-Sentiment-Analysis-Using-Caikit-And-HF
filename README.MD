<p align="center"> 
Text Sentiment Analysis using Caikit and Hugging Face combines the capabilities of both frameworks to analyze the sentiment of textual data. Caikit is a lightweight, modular machine learning library designed for rapid deployment, while Hugging Face provides a wide range of pre-trained models, particularly for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis. By leveraging Hugging Face's transformer models and integrating them with Caikitâ€™s streamlined pipeline, users can efficiently classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, making it ideal for applications in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.
